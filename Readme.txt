Documentation for Blind Users

Accessibility has been brought to the forefront of the minds of many designers and developers over recent years. Over the years, Connectivity has become a necessary domain at these time, as the diverse range of users are using the Internet for their daily uses.

Our main target also includes blind people, who rely mainly on screen readers to help them out. Well, One of the most often discussed parts of this process is making your site work with screen readers.

Screen readers are programs that are designed to read the contents of pages and programs to users, so that those with sight problems can still use computers. With most software, they work well. Microsoft Word, for example, works well with screen readers. However, on the web it is a very different story.

Though there are many problems with screen readers while surfing the web, as to blind people are not able to find specfic pieces of information which they need. Also, screen readers and modern softwares are not able to download contents (pdfs, docs etc) from the Internet.


Our team is completely equipped to help blind people to help find relevant content for them. We are going to achieve this by adding HTTP_HEADERS.
HTTP headers are also designed to allow users to determine what content they are returned from a server, specifically with the HTTP_ACCEPT header.

 For example, if you are offering an audio version of an interview in mp3 form, and the HTTP_ACCEPT header was used properly by user agents, you would be able to send a text transcript of the interview to those users who cannot interpret MP3 files. The same applies to much of the content on the web.

 The possibilities are endless and it's our sole aim to make the Web a better place for the visually-impaired and physically-disabled. Also, our domain is completely user-friendly as well as eco-friendly.
